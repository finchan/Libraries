     *Instead of a computed property, we can define the same function as
     * a method instead. For the end result, the two approaches are indeed
     * exactly the same. However, the difference is that computed properties
     * are cached based on their dependencies. A computed property will only
     * re-evaluate when some of its dependencies have changed. This means
     * as long as message has not changed, multiple access to the reversedMessage
     * computed property will immediately return the previously
     * computed result without having to run the function again.
     * In comparison, a method invocation will always run the function whenever a re-render happens.
